# Encoding-Techinques

### Why we use Encoding??<br>
* <b>Feature Encoding is used for the transformation of a categorical feature into a numerical variable. Most of the ML algorithms cannot handle categorical variables and hence it is important to do feature encoding. There are many encoding techniques used for feature engineering :</b>


* there are three kinds of categorical features-

  ><b>Ordinal :</b> The categories have an inherent order <br>
  ><b>Nominal :</b> The categories do not have an inherent order <br>
  ><b>Binary :</b> The categories in the form of either/or . FOR EXAMPLE: Yes/No type of data
